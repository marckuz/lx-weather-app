## Author
Mark Anthony Elbambo

## Library used
React

React Router

Material UI

Leaflet

Leaflet-openweathermap

Recharts

Swiper


## API used
https://openweathermap.org/ - for the Map data

https://weather.visualcrossing.com - for the charts, table and card data


## Setup
Build a frontend application using create-react-app-with-typescript as a starting point.

Setup and host the application from local (such as ngrok) or online hosted service

Complete 1 or both projects in 4-5 hours and provide a brief report on the design,
development process and tools/libraries utilised

Extra requirements can be delivered if possible within the time frame. Respond with the
report, a public link and code for the completed application.

## Project I
Design and Build a simple, single page Web Application to display local weather data within
card components and simple navigation menu

Display latest data on a card view on a route linked from the menu

Display historical weather data on multiple chart(s) on a route linked from the menu

(Extra) Present a rainfall overlay on a large map on one route linked from the menu

(Extra) Add a router library to display a detailed page on clicking the card and chart

Use any external public weather API to retrieve weather information per Location.

Interface should be simple and professional using any library, menu structure, appearance
and layout as designed by the candidate
## Project II
Utilise the framework from the React project above to filter through data using a search bar.

The page should display a prominent search bar, and list of (filterable) results.

The user can type a value in the search bar. The dataset will be filtered in real-time based on
the search.

The URL should update on every search to contain the query, and should accept a
query-string query on load if one is specified. This allows for a particular search query to be
shared externally.

UI components should use styled components.

## Guidelines Must:
Typescript
Code suitably commented
Git with commits
Material UI
Create React App
React Hooks and latest React best practices
Suitable router library
Extra
Offline Caching
AWS Amplify Integration
GraphQL Api Integration

## Outcome
WebApplication will be reviewed for aesthetics and functionality once submitted. Particularly
any engaging and interactive components . Submitted code and report will be reviewed by
LX

## Available Scripts
